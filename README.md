# Wolfram Cellular Automaton  
 
This project is an implementation of a **Wolfram Cellular Automaton** using **Pygame** and **NumPy**. Cellular automata are computational systems that evolve over discrete time steps according to predefined rules. This project visualizes the evolution of these automata on a grid, following **Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automaton rules**.

## Features  
- Simulation of **Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automaton**.  
- Adjustable rule numbers for different patterns (e.g., Rule 30, 90, 110).  
- Visualization using Pygame with customizable grid size and cell size.

## Demo  
A single cell is initialized in the center of the grid, and its evolution is visualized according to a chosen Wolfram rule.  
You can experiment with different rules by changing the `rule_number` in the `rule()` function.
